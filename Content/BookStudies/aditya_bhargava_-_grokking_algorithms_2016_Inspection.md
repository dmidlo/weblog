## Why I Picked Up This Book

- [ ] __write a [wordCount] word-length summary of your initial ‘cover-judgment’ of the book.__
- [x] __Did someone refer the book to you?__

    *[Podcast -  Talk Python, Episode 82 - Grokking Algorithms in Python](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/82/grokking-algorithms-in-python)*

  - [x] __Where were you when you found the book?, What lead you there?__

    *I was in the process of finding reference material for a beginning a study of algothims.*

    - [x] __What section did you find the book in?__

      *Books › Computers & Technology › Computer Science*

    - [x] __Note anything you like (or don’t) about visual design of the book (size, color, layout, paper, etc) that drew you to it.__

      - *Immediately the book takes on a light-hearted tone by showing a crowd of 'Arthur' style characters*
      - *I like that 'grokking' is a bit de-emphasized, it's a word of jargon for technical folks.*
        - *Since it it is in red, it's a bit less in focus, so, at quick glance, one might think the title of the book is simply 'Algorithms'*

  - [x]  __What in your memory or interest drives the intrigue to acquire the book in the first place?__
  
      *In the process of continued education, I've been trying to identify a subject in which has substantial penetration into the various fields of computer science.
      The topic of Algorithms and a deliberate and a carfully structured study therein seems to be a 'Robin's arrow' to that end.
      This is the first of a series of three books I have selected for an in depth study of algorithms*

      1. *Grokking Algorithms - An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and other Curious People, Aditya Y. Bhargava, 2016*
      2. *The Algorithm Design Manual - Second Edition, Steven S. Skiena, 2008*
      3. *Encyclopedia of Algorithms, Ming-Yang Kao(Ed.), 2008*

  - [x]  __Dissect the Title and subtitle. Describe it in adjectives__

    - *Grokking is a fun, but a bit jargony for the uninitiated*
    - *Algorithms is sounds technical, and asks the reader to put on their thinking cap*
    - *both 'illustrated' and 'other curious people' imply that this is written in a way that is accessible to an interested reader*

  - [x]  __Note any initial Questions that can be asked from just the title__
  
    - *Is this a beginner text on algorithms?*
    - *What are the algorithms covered in this book?*
  
  - [x]  __if possible at this point,__
    - [x]  __note any indications of the scope or aim of the book.__

    *In as far as the topic of Algorithms is concerned, 
    the scope of this book seems to be a beginner to intermediate treatment of the topic.
    The style implies that it is accessible to non-programmers*

    - [x]  __What subject(s) or objective(s) comes first to mind?__
 
    - *Process, Computer Science*
 
  - [x]  __Explain Why you want to read this book.__
  - *I want to read this book to develop a curriculum for my own study of algorithms and the industry domains in which they are applied.*
